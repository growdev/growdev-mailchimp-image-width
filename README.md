# Growdev MailChimp Image Width #

This is a plugin from the tutorial here:
https://github.com/growdev/growdev-mailchimp-image-width.git

An additional RSS feed is added and for each post output via the feed
all images are set to a fixed `width` and the `height` setting is removed.

This makes post by email look much better.
